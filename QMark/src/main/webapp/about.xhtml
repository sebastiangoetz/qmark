			<h1>About QMark</h1>

			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Although mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets offer
				various services and applications for their users, their energy
				consumption is a problem of top most importance. Many applications
				are implemented so inefficiently that batteries run out of power
				within hours, leading to limited uptimes and user satisfaction.</p>

			<h2>Idea</h2>
			<p>To support users by finding energy-efficient applications
				saving the batteries of their devices, QMark provides energy
				guidance in form of energy labels for mobile apps.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Depending on their genre, apps are profiled w.r.t. their
				energy consumption for a dedicated set of use cases and afterwards
				compared to other apps belonging to the same genre and providing
				similar services.</p>
			<p>The best energy-behaving app of a genre is labeled with an A,
				other apps are ranked relatively, depending on their energy
				consumption.</p>
			<p>As different users may want to use the same applications
				differently, weights can be defined by the user to consider
				different use cases of the benchmark more or less intensly in the
				average energy consumption. Therefore, users can adapt the labels
				applications are ranked with for their personal needs and interest.</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<img src="figures/esflogo.jpg" align="right" width="229" height="221" />
			<p>QMark has been developed at the Technische Universit&auml;t
				Dresden and is mainly driven by Class Wilke (&copy; 2012-2013).</p>
			<p>This research has been funded within the project
				ZESSY/QualiTune #080951806 by the European Social Fund (ESF) and
				Federal State of Saxony.</p>
